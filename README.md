# LONDON_BIKE_RIDE-PYTHON_POWERBI

This project involves analyzing London bike ride data using Python and visualizing the results in Power BI. The data is sourced from a CSV file downloaded from Kaggle. We manipulate and transform the data with Python, creating a new file that is then loaded into Power BI for visualization.

## Project Description

The project begins with a CSV file obtained from Kaggle, which contains data on bike rides in London. We utilize Python for data manipulation and transformation to derive meaningful insights from the dataset. After processing the data, a new file is created, which is subsequently loaded into Power BI to facilitate data visualization and reporting.

## Tools Used

- **Python**: For data manipulation and transformation.
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and reporting.
- **CSV File**: Source of the bike ride data downloaded from Kaggle.

## Data Manipulation Steps

1. **Download CSV from Kaggle**: The initial data file is downloaded from Kaggle.
2. **Data Processing with Python**: I use Python to clean and transform the data as needed.
3. **Create New File**: A new file is generated after data manipulation.
4. **Load to Power BI**: The newly created file is loaded into Power BI for visualization.

## Visualization

The final visualizations are created in Power BI to present insights derived from the processed bike ride data. Dashboards and reports are designed to effectively communicate the findings.
